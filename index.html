        <p><span>One day in 1995 in New York there was a woman named Ariana James, it was a normal day when she went to her college and she saw her friends after college they all went to Ariana's house and one of her friends suggested to go camping. They liked the idea and all agreed to do it next week, Ariana was so excited and ready for the trip next week, they all met next to Ariana's house and got into her car and started the trip to Forest Camping, when they arrived they were tired. They only made tents and all slept, and the next day they ate breakfast which they had bought from the market before the trip, then they all went to gather firewood and sticks to make a fire at night, Ariana found neither firewood nor sticks, so she began to go deeper into the woods, She was walking in the forest, then heard a noise from the south in a small wooden house, she entered and saw only one room with a strange door with some incomprehensible shapes and words. She was scared, but she gathered her courage and opened the door and saw a tall, faceless white man in a suit who started screaming and ran to the exit door and when she opened it she found him again. She was shocked and began to slowly back away as the man chased after her. She was very scared but her phone rang and the man screamed in an insane voice that you dont want to hear. Ariana knew he was screaming when the phone light appeared on his body, she quickly turned the flash of the phone on his body and started to come back and run out of the house the man was screaming loudly saying
"NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO KILL YOU", she ran randomly at first, then stopped running to collect her breath and opened her phone and saw that her friend called her and she was thinking about how she called her in the forest, after more than 1 hour of walking she start hear her friends voice saying her name so she start following the voice and saying "Im here" "Im here" and when she found them they asked her where she went and what happened that made her cry, she said I can't speak now. They brought her back to my house, they did not wait for sunrise, and on the way back she began to think if she told them what had happened, they would make funny of her, and when they arrived they asked her again what had happened to her, she told them the whole story and they doesn't believed her, she expected that.</span></p>

		<p><span>Next day Ariana opened the facebook and she saw the news she read it and found that they found a dead body for tall, faceless white man in a house at the forest and they start making test on the body, she was so happy and she call her friends and told them "i told you guys but you didnt beleive me".</span></p>
